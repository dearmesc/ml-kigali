# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Short Course
**African Center of Excellence in Data Science**<br>
**Kigali, Rwanda**<br>
**March 23-25, 2020**

This is a xx day short course covering various popular machine learning models and practical considerations in their implementation. Each day will include both lecture and lab components. Participants should have a basic familiarity with the Python language. Labs will be conducted using Jupyter notebooks leveraging Python libraries including [sckikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

## General Information
**Prerequisites.** Participants should have at least a basic familiar with the Python language. Fluency in a similar high-level programming language such as R is acceptable. For those who wish to review the basics:

1. [A Beginner’s Tutorial to Jupyter Notebooks](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-beginners-tutorial-to-jupyter-notebooks-1b2f8705888a)
1. [Python tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Python/default.asp)

**Materials.** Bring a laptop every day.

**Instructor Office Hours.** TBD

### Data
For this course, we will primarily be using the [iris data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) for classification, which is built into the scikit-learn library. [This forest fire data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires) provides a slightly more challenging regression task.

There are many free sources of data online. The article [Top Sources For Machine Learning Datasets](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-sources-for-machine-learning-datasets-bb6d0dc3378b) enumerates many of these sources. The following websites are great places to get started:
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
- [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/)
- [FiveThirtyEight](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)
- [Google's data set search engine](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch)

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/skotok/ml-kigali/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
